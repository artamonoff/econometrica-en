# Topics for written exam

- Panel regression analysis
	- Baseline model: specification, components of the error term
	- Baseline model provided different assumptions on the error tern: homoskedasticity, heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation
	- Baseline model provided different assumptions: pooling, random effects, fixed effects
	- Comparison tests (Hausman etc): null hypothesis, inferences, interpretation of test's report
- ARIMA model: 
	- Specification, 
	- Stationarity of AR-part, invertibility of MA-part, 
	- UR-tests (null hypothesis, inferences, interpretation of test's report)
	- Model diagnostics (null hypothesis, inferences, interpretation of tests' report)
	- Order selection methodology
- (G)ARCH-type model: specification,
- VAR model
	- Specification, stationarity
	- Choleski decomposition for the covariance matrix of the error term
	- IRFs, FEVD
	- Granger causality test
	- Model diagnostics (null hypothesis, inferences, interpretation of tests' report)
	- Order selection methodology
